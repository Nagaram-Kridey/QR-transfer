# LumenLink update log

Update this file after every meaningful project change. Each entry records **done**, **verified**,
**next**, and **blockers**. Do not call a planned step complete or replace physical data with simulation.
Dates use Asia/Kolkata (IST). The implementation checklist is in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.

## 2026-10-04 — Repository connection and persistent log

**Done:** Connected origin to https://github.com/Nagaram-Kridey/QR-transfer.git. Fetched and retained
the existing initial commit (`c25d645`) as the local branch parent; no force push or history rewrite.
Added this ongoing log and reconciled the five current planning documents while preserving originals.

**Verified:** The remote contains a main branch with an initial README only. Local Git author identity
is available. Python 3.12 is installed. Initial Python/TS conformance and codec tests pass.

**Next:** Complete protocol/benchmark documentation, rerun the browser regressions after the WebKit
camera-error fix, validate packaging/audits, commit and push the implementation, and inspect hosted CI.

**Blockers:** Android/iPhone physical trials have not been performed. Later product stages remain
behind the explicit physical gate. Pages deployment is not yet verified; no PyPI release exists.

## 2026-10-04 — Foundation and feasibility software

**Done:** Added Python CLI/reference codec, independent TypeScript codec, repeat transport, bounded
parser/session handling, safe filenames/saving, local QR renderer/scanner, seeded simulator, browser
sender/receiver harness, local worker/WASM loading, conformance fixtures and CI/Pages workflows.
Added first-play flashing acknowledgement, pause/reduced-rate controls and explicit plaintext warnings.

**Verified:** Initial 82 Python tests and 30 TypeScript tests passed; protocol-module coverage was
100% in both implementations. Python verified four independent TypeScript-generated transfers.
Production build and wheel build passed. Clean/degraded generated camera videos decoded through
the browser worker. One WebKit permission-test stub needed correction; the full rerun is pending.

**Next:** Finish the acceptance rerun and supporting documents; keep synthetic results separate from
field evidence. Push only after checking the resulting changes and update this log with actual results.

**Blockers:** No physical camera reliability evidence yet; no security/PWA/fountain completion claims.

## 2026-10-04 — Acceptance checks and camera lifecycle corrections

**Done:** Completed the wire spec, threat assumptions, prior-art/ADR documents, benchmark procedure,
CSV header and reproducible 10/100 KiB payload generator. Fixed unavailable-camera and incomplete
import states, recorded failures/timeouts, aligned the trial start with explicit receiver arming,
used high-resolution timing on Windows, and bounded filenames by UTF-8 bytes for Linux compatibility.

**Verified:** 87 Python tests pass; 30 TypeScript tests pass; both protocol coverage reports are 100%.
Ruff, format checks, mypy, ESLint and TypeScript/build checks pass. All 17 Playwright tests pass across
Chromium/Firefox/WebKit UI paths plus clean/degraded Chromium fake-camera feeds. Python fixtures are
reproducible; four independent TS transfers pass Python verification. The wheel builds and installs in
an isolated environment. npm/pip dependency audits report no known vulnerabilities (the unpublished
local package itself is not a PyPI audit entry). These are automated results, not physical measurements.

**Next:** Commit/push to the supplied main branch, inspect hosted CI, configure/verify the Pages
feasibility URL, then collect Android/iPhone physical trials using the documented protocol.

**Blockers:** Physical gate pending. GitHub Pages currently returns no configured site. Secure mode,
PWA/offline cold-start, LT research, Link Lab and final PyPI release remain future gated milestones.
